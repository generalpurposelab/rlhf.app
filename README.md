## Features
- *Supervised fine-tuning* - generate
- *Preference tuning (RLHF and more)* - generate
- *Scalable evaluation* - 

## Model Providers

This template ships with Meta's Llama 2 as the default. However, you can switch LLM providers to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/),  [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com),  or using [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com) with just a few lines of code.


## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Stack

rlhf.app is built with Next.js, the Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI, and Vercel KV.
